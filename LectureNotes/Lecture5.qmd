# Time series at the ENVR Conference

## Is a "trend" necessarily linear?

::: incremental
-   Oh no, I have to talk to the intimidating experts
-   The very first talk: "A trend doesn't have to be linear"- Robert Lund
-   The penultimate talk: "seasonal trend"
:::

Conclusion:

::: incremental
-   Nope! Seems like "trend" = "mean function"

# Detrending

## Detrending {.smaller}

If a process is trend stationary (nonstationary in the mean, but stationary in the variance), can we just subtract off the trend and get back a stationary time series?

Sometimes (assuming we are able to estimate it), and that's called **detrending**.

## Goal:

Assuming trend stationarity ($x_t = \mu_t + y_t$, where $y_t$ is stationary), find an estimate $\widehat{\mu}_t$ and compute

$$
\begin{align}
\widehat{y_t} &= x_t - \widehat{\mu_t}\\
\text{Estimated Stationary process} &= \text{Data - trend estimate}
\end{align}
$$ Note: Does $y_t$ remind you of anything from regression?

## Example: Subtracting off the trend

Does this time series appear stationary? In the mean, yes.

## Example: Subtracting off the trend

Have we captured the temporal structure in the time series? Yes (note: we will learn about ACF hypothesis tests/p-values during the "time series data analysis process")

## Aside: managing a time series project code base

-   I manage the [GitHub for Houston Wastewater Epidemiology](https://github.com/hou-wastewater-epi-org/online_trend_estimation/)
-   Check out the "issues"
-   Section 1: Demo adding new issue ("basic" time series methods)
-   Section 2: Demo adding new issue (link to definition of online estimation)

## [Activity 1: Detrending a commodity (Example 3.7)]{.r-fit-text} {.smaller}

-   Given the code to generate the plot with the trend line, how would you view the equation of the trend line?
-   Visualize the de-trended series. Does it appear stationary?
-   Compute the acf of the salmon series and the detrended series. What do you notice?

## [Activity 2: "assuming we are able to estimate it"]{.r-fit-text}

-   Look at pages 37-41 of the textbook
-   what is "it" in this context? (what are we estimating?)
-   If this is review, where did you first see these ideas?

# Differencing

## Motivation/model {.smaller}

Consider the trend stationary model ($y_t$ is stationary). $$
x_t = \mu_t + y_t
$$ We saw how to estimate a *fixed* trend using a linear regression for the mean ($\mu_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1t$)

We then subtract off the estimate of the trend (detrend), $\widehat{\mu_t}$ so that we are working with a stationary time series:

$$
\widehat{y_t} = x_t - \widehat{\mu_t}
$$

What if the trend was not fixed? (dependent on $t$ beyond just "$t$ as a constant")

## A stochastic trend model

Change the model for the mean to incorporate a stochastic component (random walk with drift):

$$
\mu_t = \delta + \mu_{t-1} + w_t
$$ Where $w_t$ is white noise independent of $y_t$.

Is $\mu_t$ stationary? No (it's a random walk, nonstationary in both mean and covariance)

## How to "get back" to a stationary time series?

Since the stochastic component depends on just one past time point, consider the series $x_t - x_{t-1}$.

This series is called the **differenced** series and the process is called **differencing**.

## [Computing the difference series in terms of the (stochastic) trend model]{.r-fit-text}

$$
\begin{align}
x_{t} - x_{t-1} &= (\mu_t + y_t) - (\mu_{t-1} - y_{t-1})\\
&= (\delta + \mu_{t-1} + w_t + y_t) - (\mu_{t-1} - y_{t-1})\\
& = \delta + w_t + y_t - y_{t-1}
\end{align}
$$ Need to compute mean function $\E(x_t - x_{t-1}$ and autocovariance function $cov(x_t - x_{t-1}, x_s- x_{s-1})$ and check if they do not depend on $t$ (mean) and just depend on the lag $h = s-t$.

...But the answer is we do get a stationary series!

## [Activity 3: Simulating a random walk and then differencing it]{.r-fit-text}

1.  Simulate a random walk with no drift and plot it.

```{r}
#| eval: false

## Simulate random walk w/ drift
## your code here 
```

2.  Use the `diff` function to difference the simulated series. Plot the result.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# your code here
```

3.  Does this series appear stationary? How do you know?
4.  Visualize the ACF of the differenced series. Does it look like white noise?

```{r}
#| eval: false
# your code here
```

## [Activity 4: Differencing Salmon Prices]{.r-fit-text}

1.  Compute and plot the differenced salmon series.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# your code here
```

2.  Does the series appear stationary?
3.  Visualize the acf of the differenced series. Does it look like white noise?

```{r}
#| eval: true
```

## [Activity 5: Comparing Differencing and Detrending]{.r-fit-text}

Compare the Acfs of the differenced and detrended salmon series. What do you notice?

```{r}
#| eval: false

# your code here
```

## Next time: Smoothing

We've seen three explicity ways of modeling a trend (moving average (hw 1), and regression with time and random walk).

How else could we model a trend?

## Visual example:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show

tsplot(soi, col=4)
lines(ksmooth(time(soi), soi, "normal", bandwidth=1), lwd=2, col=6)
par(fig = c(.65, 1, .75, 1), new = TRUE) # the insert
curve(dnorm, -3, 3,  xaxt='n', yaxt='n', ann=FALSE)
```
