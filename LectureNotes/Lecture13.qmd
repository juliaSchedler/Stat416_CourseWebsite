## Agenda

-   SARIMA simulation activity

-   FPP sections 8.1-8.3 (Also 9.10 if time)

-   Sign up for Github Copilot

## SARIMA simulation activity setup

-   Log on to the lab computer

-   Launch R and install whichever package you want to use

- Let me know when you are ready


## SARIMA simulation activity{.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
- Choose a pecan
- Whether $p,q, P, Q$ are nonzero are determined on the pecan (dot goes on the left)
- Choose $d$ yourself 
- I will come around and assign you seasonal or nonseasonal
- If you get seasonal, choose $D$ yourself
- simulate from your model using `arima.sim`, then try to recover your model using tools from class.

## SARIMA simulation activity
- Hide your simulation code and leave just the output you generated
- Switch computers with a partner
- Can you recover the model your partner used to simulate the data?

## Record your result
- In the big ledger book, use a stamp of your choice
- Use purple if you were not able to recover the model order, and green if you were

## FPP 8.1-8.3
We will work through these examples collaboratively. 

## Github copilot
- Make a github account (or log in)-- USE A PERSONAL EMAIL (or add one to your account)
- Sign up for the copilot beta
- In Rstudio, go to Tools --> Global Options --> copilot and sign in with your github account
- When you get approved, you will be able to use copilot in Rstudio (you might have to go through the Global options setup again)

## If time-- Sunspot data

```{r}
library(astsa)
tsplot(sunspots)
?sunspots
```
