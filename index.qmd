# Welcome to Time Series! {.unnumbered}

The lecture slides and code here are heavily drawn from the book I have selected for this course with some additional examples and visualizations that I think would be helpful for learning these important concepts!

Also, big thanks to our Lab Assistant, Bena Smith, for serving as editor for these notes (assuming I get them to her in time. Don't blame Bena for missed typos).
