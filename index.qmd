# Welcome to Time Series! {.unnumbered}

The lecture slides and code here are heavily drawn from examples in book I have selected for this course: [Time Series Analysis: A Data Analysis Approach Using R](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429273285/time-series-robert-shumway-david-stoffer). I am extremely grateful to the authors for doing the heavy lifting of curating the data sets, code, and problem sets. Please consider purchasing this book for referenceâ€” it's wonderful, and there's [a more technical graduate version as well](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-52452-8) for those of you that yearn for more technical detail.

The cover is red with a time series plot of Monthly Carbon Dioxide readings at Mauna Loa Observatory. The time series shows an increasing trend with seasonan oscillations."}

I have also added some additional examples from my own work and visualizations of simulations, covariance functions, etc., that I think would be helpful for learning these important concepts.

Also, big thanks to our Lab Assistant, Bena Smith, for serving as editor for these notes (assuming I get them to her in time. Don't blame Bena for missed typos).
